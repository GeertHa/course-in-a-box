## Learning about "Computer and Networking"

Computers as well as the connections between them are important technological facilitators of human interconnection. Understanding both parts (the computer itself and the networks connecting them) is the main goal of this course.

To understand these things, it is important that you understand some of the basic principles of the internal workings of the machine we call a computer. This has a conceptual and a practical implementation aspect: understanding how it works and which specific parts we find in modern computers is what computer architecture is all about.

Of course computers are not only hardware. They are just as much software. One very important component that we are all confronted with if we're using computers, is the operating system. Here to, just as in computer architecture, it is just as important to understand what operating systems do and what is important in designing operating systems, as it is to understand concrete implementations of operating systems. Two of the most important modern operating systems nowadays are Microsoft Windows and Linux (as the most important variant of UNIX). It is important that you get to know these both and how they implement the operating system design principles mentioned before.

The last, and certainly not least aspect, of modern computing we would like to introduce in this course, is networking. Here to it is important to destinguish the basic principles behind networking and their concrete implementation within one most prominent framework, namely TCP/IP. 
		
## OK, but who is organizing this?

This course will be taught in the context of a bachelor course called "Computer and Networking" and taking the exam at the end of the course will give you officialy recognised credit towards a bachelor degree. The bachelor degree is called "New Media and Communication Technology" and is being organized by the University College of West-Flanders (Howest) in Kortrijk, Belgium. Although the community will be starting with students from this institution, it is by no means the intention that it will be only for them. Everyone can participate and help build a community driven course teachin the above topics. If you want to earn your official credit though, you will need to get in touch with our institution. This can be done at any time.
